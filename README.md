# rock-paper-scissors

This is a hand game played by two persons. Each person simultaneously forms rock, paper or scissors. Paper beats(covers) rock, rock beats (crushes), but scissors beats (cuts) paper. The reverse will create a loosing position, i.e rock loses to paper and so on.

A detail on how to form a either of these three shapes with the hand is presented in wikipedia encyclopedia.

The goal of this project is to design a computer program that can play the game. Here the two players involved are the computer, and a human being. Whereas, the computer returns rock, paper or scissors randomly, the human and form any of them with the hand and confirms the winner!
